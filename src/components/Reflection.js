                Road to Hire meant to me, a chance, a new opportunity, another door or window to open.
                My biggest strength would have to be Javascript and troubleshooting.
                I plan to use this to sell myself, through my strong skills in javascript as well as to 
                be able to find a solution to technical problems.
                I am still able to improve with my biggest area of opportunity being my professional development skills. 
                I will continue to challenge myself using the road talks, receiving criticisms, as well as experimenting 
                to go above and beyond.
